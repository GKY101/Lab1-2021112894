Improvements in DNA sequencing have both broadened its utility and 
dramatically increased the size of sequencing datasets. Sequencing instruments are 
now used regularly as sources of high-resolution evidence for genotyping,
methylation profiling, DNA-protein interaction mapping, and characterizing gene 
expression in the human genome and in other species.
